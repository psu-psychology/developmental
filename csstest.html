<p class="biotext">Liz is a postdoc in psychology working with Dr. Kristin Buss. She earned her Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine in 2009. Her research focuses on understanding how emotion regulation relates to adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning) and maladaptive outcomes (e.g., anxiety) in childhood. Her research aims to identify regulatory strategies that children can use to effectively alleviate negative emotion, and to identify individual differences in children's biology and social experiences that determine whether they can regulate emotion effectively. She is also interested in identifying mechanisms responsible for effective emotion regulation (e.g., attentional focus) to explain why certain emotion regulation strategies attenuate negative emotion and distress. Ultimately, this program of research will provide an empirical basis for interventions aimed at improving children's emotion regulation abilities and mitigating risk for maladaptive outcomes.</p>
