			<h3>Bradley Taber-Thomas (email: <a href="mailto:brathoma@gmail.com">brathoma@gmail.com</a>)</h3>
			<div class="bio-text">
				<p>Brad received his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Iowa in 2011, and worked as a Postdoc with Dr. William Lovallo at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. He also received an MA in Philosophy in 2008 from Georgia State University. He has studied the role of the fronto-limbic neural system in affective and social functioning, working to delineate underlying cognitive processes such as guiding attention to salient information and integrating affective information into behavioral organization. Building on this work, he is researching preventive interventions in youth for cultivating those cognitive processes (e.g., attention training, mindfulness, and behaviorist approaches) to prevent affective and behavioral disorders and promote fronto-limbic development and psychological well-being. His interdisciplinary approach focuses on social and emotional processes at multiple levels (basic and applied), from multiple perspectives (neural, psychological, and philosophical), and with multiple methods (neuroimaging, lesion, intervention, and high-risk populations). When not doing all of that fun stuff, he is most likely playing hockey, riding his bike, or cooking and playing board games with his partner.</p>
