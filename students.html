<h3>Liz Davis, Ph.D.</h3>
<img src="img/davis_sq.png" /><h3>Liz Davis (email: <a href="mailto:eld14@psu.edu">eld14@psu.edu</a>)</h3>
<p>Liz is a postdoc in psychology working with Dr. Kristin Buss. She earned her Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine in 2009. Her research focuses on understanding how emotion regulation relates to adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning) and maladaptive outcomes (e.g., anxiety) in childhood. Her research aims to identify regulatory strategies that children can use to effectively alleviate negative emotion, and to identify individual differences in children's biology and social experiences that determine whether they can regulate emotion effectively. She is also interested in identifying mechanisms responsible for effective emotion regulation (e.g., attentional focus) to explain why certain emotion regulation strategies attenuate negative emotion and distress. Ultimately, this program of research will provide an empirical basis for interventions aimed at improving children's emotion regulation abilities and mitigating risk for maladaptive outcomes.</p>

<h3>Kiren Khan (email: <a href="mailto:kxk953@psu.edu">kxk953@psu.edu</a>)</h3>
<p>I am a sixth-year graduate student in Developmental Psychology working with Dr. Keith Nelson. I received my bachelors degree in Psychology and English from the University of Pennsylvania in 2006. Broadly, my research interests include language development &ndash;spanning both early native language development as well as second language learning. More specifically, I am interested in how cognitive skills interplay with, and support, language skills in young children and in adults. One major line of empirical inquiry has focused on examining the cognitive and motivational factors that facilitate the acquisition of narrative and syntactic structures in young children. A separate line of investigation that I am currently pursuing is how individual differences in executive function skill components predict native language production in adults, and the acquisition of grammatical structures in Spanish-English bilinguals. <br />
